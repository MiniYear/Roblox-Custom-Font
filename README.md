# Roblox-Custom-Font

Custom Font allows you to add new font type into Roblox, use them similiarly to regular texts!
Custom Font currently only supports OpenType (.otf) font files.

# How to use

1. Go to: > WindowsFormsApp2 > bin > Release
2. Run WindowsFormsApp2.exe
3. Set font file (Must be OpenType)
4. Set output directory
5. Set prefered text size (It won't matter much in Roblox, although I recommend 36 for the best quality)
6. Create the font image and output positions & sizes
7. Upload image file as a decal in Roblox
8. Insert output file in your game as a module. (Preferably use a repository folder)
9. Use the [CustomFont module in Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/library/12528534296/Roblox-Custom-Font-Manager) to easily write texts or perhaps create one of your own!
